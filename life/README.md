Overall I think this went well. I'm not sure if I implemented the complement correctly but other that that, it was smooth. The biggest hurdle was learning what crates and what objects to use for the microbit. I worked on a project over the holiday break using an arduino and different HAL so I had to rewire my brain a little bit.
